Calculate and return number of 1s in binary representation of given number n.
Input format :
Integer n
Output Format :
In one line print the total number of 1s which satisfy above description
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 2^63 - 1
Sample Input :
 4
Sample Output :
 1
Sample Input Explanation :
4 can be represented as 100 in binary, which has only one 1 in binary representation.


Solution:-
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
def b(x):
    global c
    if x>1:
        b(x//2)
    a=x%2
    if a==1:
         c=c+1

c=0
n=int(input())
b(n)
print(c)
