Given an integer n, calculate the sum of all possible proper divisors of n.
Proper divisor of a natural number, is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.
Note : You have to return the sum.
Input Format : Integer n.

Output Format : Integer answer

Sample Input 1 :
20
Sample Output 1 :
22
Sample Input 2 :
10
Sample Output 2 :
8
Sample Output 1 Explanation :
20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22



Solution:-

## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.

n=int(input())
s=0
for i in range(1,n):
    if n%i==0:
        s=s+i
print(s)
