Given an integer n, print all palindromic numbers from 1 to n.
Palindromes are those numbers that reads the same backwards as forwards.
Note : Order of numbers doesn't matter.
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^9
Input format :
Integer n
Output Format :
Print numbers in different line
Sample Input 1 :
12
Sample Output 1 :
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
11

Solution:-
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i<9:
        print(i)
    elif str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:
        print(i)
